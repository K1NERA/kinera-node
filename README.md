# Kinera Development Overview

## Introduction

Kinera aims to revolutionize the media landscape by establishing a network of peer-to-peer relationships that span production, ownership, distribution, and curation while providing tools to support these processes. The Invisible Hand Lab team has significantly advanced this project, taking it from a mere concept to a minimum viable product. From day one, we've had clear plans and goals. From today on, Polkadot token holders can test our working-in-progress features for organizing and classifying video content that is ready to be used to build streaming products and services. Kinera aims to be the hub for those who want to transform the media experience.

## Kinera Stack

### Invisible Hand Lab
Invisible Hand Lab is our current legal structure. On the [webpage](https://invisiblehandlab.org), you can find our job offers and meet the team.

### Kinera Website
The official website for the Kinera application can be found at [kinera.network](https://kinera.network). It offers detailed information about the project, including its objectives, features, blog, and in the near future, the roadmap. Here, you can subscribe to our newsletter, which is the best way to stay informed about the latest developments and updates.

### Kinera dApp
The Kinera Minimum Viable Product is accessible on [d-app.kinera.network](https://d-app.kinera.network). It was designed to provide users with a seamless and intuitive experience, and we invite users to test it and provide feedback for further refinement.

In this first version, users can:
- Propose, access, and participate in film and video rankings
- Propose and participate in competition games to choose the best content
- Use the social network to publish content, upvote and downvote it, follow the best curators, and publish your favorite constellations.

## Polkadot Treasury Proposal
- [OpenGov Treasury Proposal Referenda](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/774)
After two years of discreet work, Referenda 774 on Polkassembly introduces the Kinera network to the Polkadot community, whom we invite to give feedback and, if they agree, to vote. This funding will enable the Kinera team to enhance the infrastructure and accelerate its development. To encourage voter turnout and maximize its engagement, 0.5% of the future Kinera tokens will be distributed to all the wallets [created before May 4] that vote, no matter how they vote or the outcome.

## Ongoing Work
The development of Kinera is progressing steadily, with significant milestones already achieved. The MVP is pivotal in creating a comprehensive and user-centric decentralized application and shows that people choose content that reflects their interests better than algorithms.
